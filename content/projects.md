* [Nvim Support for R Code](https://github.com/danilka4/ts_r) (November, 2022): Built a plug-in for neovim that takes advantage of nvim's integrated terminal-mode to process R code within the neovim session.
The plugin takes advantage of R's syntax tree to allow the user to send logical lines and chunks of code to the terminal, replicating some behaviors of RStudio.
    - Tools used: Neovim, git, [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter), lua
* [Currency Profitability Model](https://www.overleaf.com/read/rptmrcssxxzh) (February, 2022): Created a notebook with a team that used Q-Learning and self-made models to maximize profitability through purchasing either bitcoin or gold in late 2020-early 2021. Won a Meritorious Winner Award (top 8%).

    - Tools used: RStudio, \\(\\LaTeX\\), MATLAB
* [Show Recommendation System](https://github.com/danilka4/anime-recommendation-database-2020) (Summer, 2021): Created a collaborative filtering recommendation system for Japanese animation which predicted the top-N recommendations
    - Tools used: RStudio, vim, git
* [Fruit Identification Neural Network](https://www.kaggle.com/code/danielpalamarchuk/identifying-fruits-and-staleness-using-keras) (Summer, 2021): Created a convoluted neural network from scratch to classify between six different stale/fresh fruits
    - Tools used: RStudio, vim, git
* [Vespa Wasp Identification System](https://github.com/danilka4/MCM-2021) (February, 2021):
Created a notebook with a team that used exploratory data visualization, Gaussian Naive Bayes, binary image classification, and frequency analysis models to identify Vespa Mandarinia wasps in Oregon.
