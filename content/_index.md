Hello and welcome to my personal website!
My name is Daniel Palamarchuk, and I am a PhD Computer Science (CS) student at the University of Maryland (UMD).
I am advised by [Dr. Fumeng Yang](https://www.fmyang.com/) and am interested in studying **large language models** (LLM) as complex systems and their interactions with humans as **cybernetic systems**.

Before UMD, I graduated from Virginia Tech (VT) in May 2024 with MS CS.
There, I was advised by [Dr. Chris North](https://people.cs.vt.edu/north/) and researched **dynamic topic modeling**.
Specifically, I developed a cluster-based for temporally aligned word and doc2vec topic discovery.

I also had the pleasure of attending VT's undergraduate program, where I graduated in May 2023 with dual bachelor degrees in Computer and Data Science and minors in political science and math.

Various parts about me are linked on the left, including my social media and GitHub (for source code, go there).
