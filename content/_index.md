Hello and welcome to my personal website!
My name is Daniel Palamarchuk, and I am a PhD Computer Science (CS) student at the University of Maryland (UMD).
I graduated from Virginia Tech (VT) in May 2024 with MS CS.
I also had the pleasure of attending VT's undergraduate program, where I graduated in May 2023 with dual bachelor degrees in Computer and Data Science.

Various parts about me are linked on the left, including my social media and GitHub (for source code, go there).
The best way to get ahold of me is via email at: dpalam@umd.edu
