Hello and welcome to my personal website!
My name is Daniel Palamarchuk and I am a student at Virginia Tech.
I am currently pursuing dual bachelor degrees in CS and Data Analytics, as well as a master's in CS.

I have linked various parts about me on the left and attached my socials and GitHub, where one can find the source code for all the projects I have done.

The best way to get ahold of me is via email at: d4n1elp@vt.edu
