Hello and welcome to my personal website!
My name is Daniel Palamarchuk and I am a CS Graduate student at Virginia Tech with Bachelor's Degrees in CS and Data Analytics.

I have linked various parts about me on the left and attached my socials and GitHub, where one can find the source code for all the projects I have done.
