Hello and welcome to my personal website!
My name is Daniel Palamarchuk and I am a student at Virginia Tech.
I have graduated from Virginia Tech's undergraduate program with dual bachelor degrees in CS and Data Analytics.
I recently also graduated with a Master's of Science in CS, concentrating on Natural Language Processing.

I have linked various parts about me on the left and attached my socials and GitHub, where one can find the source code for all the noteworthy projects I have done.

I may set up a blog here at some point.

The best way to get ahold of me is via email at: d4n1elp@vt.edu
