# Tinkering with Linux on Personal School Laptop

I scrapped windows from my laptop and installed Arch Linux on it.
Since then I have configured a terminal-based environment based on Neovim to code, take notes, and write my essays.
Recently set up wiki to organize my master's notes.

# Reading Machine Learning and Political Theory

I have set up a shell script on my laptop that will allow me to open a reading from various books and articles I have downloaded on my laptop.
Alongside it also opens up notes for the specific reading in Neovim.
If I did not have any notes beforehand, it will open up an empty document.

After I am finished with the reading, I can open up a centralized bibliography "bib" file in Neovim and add the reading to it so I can later call it up in any essays I write in \\(\\LaTeX\\).

# Magic: the Gathering

I have played Magic since Theros in 2013, though I got more into it during Shadows of Innistrad in 2016.
I used to play standard, and currently play modern (WB Smallpox), pauper (Mono B Zombies, among other decks), and commander (WUB Varina Zombies, among other [mostly] aggressive decks).
My [Tappedout](https://tappedout.net/users/MutaliskLord4) has all my decks.

# Biking

I enjoy biking to classes, general local travel, and for leisure.
